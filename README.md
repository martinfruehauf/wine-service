# wine-service
This project is going to be a service for handling measurements of acid, sugar, alcohol etc. for the process of creating (mainly apple) wine. Once this has been released for a firs time, a corresponding angular project will be created. Initially, it is going to utilize a H2 which will later be substituted with a Postgres db.
